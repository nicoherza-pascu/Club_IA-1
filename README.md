# Club IA #1: Data cleaning and linear regression
This repository is dedicated to the first meeting of the Pascual Bravo AI's Club: Data cleaning and linear regression.

VisualStudio Code is suggested.

* To clone this repo use: git clone https://github.com/tu-usuario/tu-repo.git
* To create branch: git checkout -b nombre

Everyone should work in it's own branch as we like to recreate a colaborative workspace

After the project is cloned, it's necessary to create an enviroment inside the project, in our own branch, to run Python.

First we move through the folders using cd command. Then we create the enviroment: 
* py -m venv venv
* Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process
* .\venv\Scripts\Activate

After we have our enviroment created you must start installing some libraries. A requirements.txt is not available as we want to recreate the experience of start working in a project for the first time.
